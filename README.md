# healthcare-analysis
This project is aimed at analyzing medical conditions and predicting outcomes based on various features related to patients and healthcare providers. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

Project Structure
1. Main.ipynb: The primary notebook where the entire data processing, analysis, and modeling steps are carried out.
2. medical condition analysis.ipynb: A focused analysis on specific medical conditions, including performance metrics and visualizations.
3. predictive analysis.ipynb: Notebook dedicated to developing and evaluating predictive models for medical outcomes.

This project was to develop predictive models that could accurately classify patient outcomes based on historical data. Using a variety of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, we were able to build models that not only predict the likelihood of recovery but also provide insights into the factors that most significantly impact these predictions.   

In addition to predictive modeling, the project also focuses on performance analysis of doctors and hospitals. By analyzing test results, billing data, and patient outcomes, we were able to identify top-performing healthcare providers and understand the factors contributing to their success. This analysis is critical in helping healthcare institutions allocate resources more effectively and improve patient care standards.
